# kx-introduction

This repository provides an introductory guide to working with the **q programming language** and **kdb+**, a high-performance time-series database from [KX](https://kx.com/). It is intended for developers, data engineers, and analysts who want to get hands-on experience with the q language and understand the fundamentals of kdb+.

## 📘 Overview

The repository contains:

- A set of q scripts to explore the syntax, data types, and operations in q.
- Examples of table creation, joins, aggregation, and functional programming features in q.
- Notes and comments to help beginners understand the q language.

## 🧠 What is q/kdb+?

- **q** is a concise, expressive programming language built for working with large-scale time-series data.
- **kdb+** is a columnar, in-memory database optimized for real-time and historical data analytics, particularly used in finance, telecom, and IoT.

## 📁 Contents

- `kx-introduction.q`: A single q script that introduces:
  - Basic q syntax and expressions
  - Lists, dictionaries, and tables
  - Select and update statements
  - Functional programming in q
  - Data manipulation examples
